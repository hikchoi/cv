## Profile

While the domain and area of development varies in my professional work, my primary goal is to ultimately build tools that can empower users, and more importantly, myself. 

Therefore, I approach problems from a user-centric point of view and build what is necessary in solving that problem. At the same time I work hard to facilitate the process of building said tools, empowering myself and my team along the way. 

As a result, I do not limit my voice to the specific tasks I am given and responsible for. I try to observe and understand how each piece of the puzzle serves the goal while also pondering over better ways to cut out those puzzle pieces.
