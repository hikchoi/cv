### Undergraduate Research Assistant, Human-Computer Interaction Lab, University of Waterloo

> Location: Waterloo, Ontario
>
> Duration: Jan 2014 - May 2014

Human Computer Interaction lab is a research lab at the University of Waterloo. The lab focuses primarily on mixed reality, input device, interaction techniques, info-vis, crowdsourcing, and robotics. Under co-supervision of Prof. Edward Lank and Prof. Daniel Vogel, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in charge of running controlled studies to assess performance of a novel interaction technique.

#### Acheivements
- Ran and recorded controlled studies assessing peformance of a novel and enhanced "Pinch-to-Zoom" technique called "Pinch-to-Zoom-Plus (PZP)".
- PZP is an extension to the standard pinch-to-zoom gesture in touch devices that reduces clutching and panning.
- As a member of the lab, I participated in weekly lab meetings and delivered study data that resulted in a published paper in UIST 2014.
